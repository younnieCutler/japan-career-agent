# Changelog

## [1.5.0] — 2026-08-03

- Documented the status-bar version check, its 24-hour cadence, and the opt-out environment
  variable in all three README files and `AGENTS.md`.
- Reduced always-loaded agent context by moving onboarding, routing, market-flow, persistence,
  learning, and architecture details into lazy `_shared/agent_context/` references.
- Added bounded PyYAML dependency metadata, Ruff CI linting, manifest metadata parity checks, a
  safe status-bar truncation path, README contract checks, and contribution/release templates.
- Fixed the duplicate `2b` architecture heading and bumped the plugin manifests to `1.5.0`.

## [1.4.0]

- Evidence-based v3 alignment, approval-gated career state, workspace routing, lazy job-seeker
  references, and compressed status-bar context.
